title: KEC Computer Build Tool Installation and H Drive Mounting
---

This page contains a step-by-step guide through the steps required to finalize
the WSL2 installation on KEC lab computers. **Note that the Linux virtual machine is
configured on a per machine basis. Therefore, if you use different computers in KEC,
you'll need to run these steps on each.**
<br><br>



## Part 1: Create a username/password in your Linux Virtual Machine

---

* **Step 1:** Start your Linux Virtual Machine by running **Ubuntu** from the Windows 
Start/Applications menu.

* **Step 2:** If this is your first time running the Linux Virtual Machine on the lab
computer you should see a prompt in the Linux terminal to "Enter new UNIX username". 
Here, you will need to create a username and password.  This is NOT the same username and 
password that you use to log into Windows. This account is specifically for the Linux 
virtual machine.  However, you can certainly use the same username and password for 
Windows and your Linux VM if you like. **Create your Linux username and password to 
finalize the installation.**

## Part 2: Install Build Tools (Required packages for CS350, CS420, etc.)

---

* **Step 1:** Your Linux VM should still be running. If not, you can restart your Linux 
VM by running it from the Windows Start/Applications menu. Copy and paste the following 
command into your **Linux terminal** to update the package manager. You will be 
prompted for the password that you recently created for this Linux VM. Enter your password
to proceed.

> ```
> sudo apt-get -y update
> ```


* **Step 2:** Copy and paste the following line into your new **Linux terminal** 
to install required build tools and packages. This may take a few minutes.

> ```
> sudo apt-get -y install build-essential
> ```


* **Step 3:** Copy and paste the following line into your new **Linux terminal** 
to install the remaining required packages. This may take a few minutes.

> ```
> sudo apt-get -y install make cmake gcc clang gdb valgrind curl wget git perl zip
> ```


* **Step 4:** Copy and paste the following line into your new **Linux terminal** to ensure 
that your Windows and Linux filesystems and applications can interact properly.

> ```
> sudo wget -O /etc/wsl.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ycpcs/dev-env-setup-guide/gh-pages/prog_envs/_config/wsl.conf
> ```


<br><br>



## Part 3: Mount the H Drive

---

* **Step 1:** Your Linux VM should still be running. If not, you can restart your Linux 
VM by running it from the Windows Start/Applications menu. Copy and paste the following 
command into your **Linux terminal** to create a mount point for your H: drive.  You'll
be prompted for your Linux VM password.

> ```
> sudo mkdir -m 777 /mnt/h
> ```


* **Step 2:** In the same terminal window, copy and paste the following command to make
a permanent entry into your file-systems table.  This will ensure that your H: drive is 
mounted each and every time your start your Linux virtual machine.

> ```
> echo "H:\ /mnt/h drvfs noatime,uid=1000,gid=1000,metadata,defaults 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab > /dev/null
> ```


* **Step 3:** In the same terminal window, copy and paste the following command to mount 
the H: drive in your current terminal session.

> ```
> sudo mount -a
> ```
