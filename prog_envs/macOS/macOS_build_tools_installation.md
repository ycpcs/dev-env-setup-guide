## Download and Install the Latest Xcode Development Tools

---

* **Step 1:** From the macOS **App Store**, download and install **Xcode**. 
A link to Xcode is [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).


* **Step 2:** Run the **Xcode** application and agree to the license agreement to complete the installation process. Close **Xcode**.


* **Step 3:** Install the remaining development tools that you'll need for this course.  Open your **Terminal** application (**Applications -> Utilities**) and run the following command:

> ```shell
> sudo xcode-select --install
> ```


* **Step 4 (M1 and M2-based Macs only):** If you have an **M1** or **M2**-based Mac, you'll also need to install **Rosetta 2** to translate `x86` instructions to `ARM` instructions. Open your **Terminal** application (**Applications -> Utilities**) and run the following command:

> ```shell
> /usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
> ```
